# dbt-on-rails — Project Overview

This repository contains a small dbt project and supporting assets for exploring rail network data. The generated README here summarizes structure and common commands without modifying the original README.

## Purpose
- Provide dbt models, macros, seeds, and snapshots for a rail network dataset.
- Use DuckDB as a convenient local query engine for development and testing.

## Repo layout (important paths)
- `rail_network/` — dbt project root containing models, macros, seeds, snapshots, and config.
- `rail_network/models/` — prosduction models, including `transformation/` and `sources.yml`.
- `rail_network/seeds/` — seed data (e.g. `gemeente_2025.geojson`).
- `rail_network/data/dev.duckdb` — local DuckDB file used for development.
- `rail_network/macros/` — reusable SQL macros (e.g. `common_columns.sql`).

## Prerequisites
- Install dbt with the DuckDB adapter (for example via pip or Homebrew). Example:

```bash
# using pip
pip install dbt-core dbt-duckdb
```

- Ensure DuckDB is available (the dbt-duckdb adapter will handle this).

## Quickstart (run from repository root)
1. Change into the dbt project folder:

```bash
cd rail_network
```

2. (Optional) Inspect or create the `profiles.yml` as needed — a `profiles.yml` already exists in the project for reference.

3. Load seeds and run models:

```bash
dbt seed
dbt run
dbt test
```

4. Open the DuckDB file interactively if desired:

```bash
duckdb data/dev.duckdb
# then run SQL queries against the generated tables
```

## Development notes
- Models are organized under `models/transformation/` and schemas are declared in `schema.yml` next to the models.
- Macros in `macros/` provide shared logic such as common column definitions.
- Seeds and snapshots help reproduce baseline datasets and historical snapshots.

## Where to look next
- DBT models: `rail_network/models/transformation/`
- Macros: `rail_network/macros/common_columns.sql`
- Seeds: `rail_network/seeds/`
